:: Notes:
:: - xIntensities of 128-1024 usually work fine. Feel free to tweak it to your liking, but
::   keep the xIntensity to a multiple of 64.
::   Note that higher intensities can sometimes lower your hashrate, since it creates more
::   work units at once; after a certain point, the work units take longer to return and
::   this will actually decrease your hashrate.
:: - If you have an integrated GPU, you might have to set the OpenCL platform correctly
::   using --gpu-platform. --gpu-platform=1 usually works here if the default isn't working.
